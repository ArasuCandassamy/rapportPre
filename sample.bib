The displacement formulation is introduced, but standard linear ﬁnite elements suffer from locking when the Lam´e constant is large. To overcome this, a displacement-pressure formulation using stable Stokes elements and a stress-displacement formulation with H(div)conforming spaces for symmetric matrix functions are presented.},

The displacement formulation focuses on ﬁnding the displacement ﬁeld that minimizes a functional, while the stress-displacement formulation directly computes the stresses. The wellposedness of these formulations relies on Korn’s inequalities, inf-sup conditions, and the coercivity of bilinear forms.},

	abstract = {Psydac is a Python 3 library for the solution of partial diﬀerential equations, which combines the convenience of a domain speciﬁc language with the speed of a high-performance parallel engine. Its main focus is on isogeometric analysis using tensor-product B-spline ﬁnite elements; to this end it uses an optimized sparse format called “stencil matrix”, which drastically reduces memory storage compared to the popular CSR/CSC formats. It supports multi-patch mapped geometries, and ﬁnite element exterior calculus. It can distribute each domain patch across many MPI processes, with multiple OpenMP threads operating in each block.},

	abstract = {This review paper collects several results that form part of the theoretical foundation of isogeometric methods. We analyse variational techniques for the numerical resolution of PDEs based on splines or NURBS and we provide optimal approximation and error estimates in several cases of interest. The theory presented also includes estimates for T-splines, which are an extension of splines allowing for local refinement. In particular, we focus our attention on elliptic and saddle point problems, and we define spline edge and face elements. Our theoretical results are demonstrated by a rich set of numerical examples. Finally, we discuss implementation and efficiency together with preconditioning issues for the final linear system.},
